  This tool will be helpful in assisting the executor or power of attorney of your estate. Organizing your estate will bring peace of mind to you and to your heirs.

<h3>Additional Considerations</h3>

ou have filled in the information on Estate Organizer send yourself a calendar invitiation that repeats annually to review the information and make necessary changes.
<p>
Will - It is recommended that you review your will every three to five years or as per your lawyerâ€™s advice.  However, you should review your will whenever circumstances in your life have changed, such as marriage as the will prior to marriage would normally be revoked, a death, separation or divorce, the birth of a child or your child or children have become of age and no longer need a guardian.  Also, if you had a specific asset which was willed and you have disposed of it.  A will should also be reviewed after a change to income tax laws or any other relevant legislation. Name an executor that you trust and that will have the time to execute your will as it is time consuming and you want to make sure that your affairs are in order for the beneficiaries.
</p>
<p>
  Powers of Attorney - In most provinces there are two types of powers of attorney, medical and financial, in case one becomes mentally incapacitated.
</p>

<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<p>
Probate Fees - At death the executor will most likely have to have a court declare your will is valid and in order to deal with certain assets.  Depending on the amount of the assets, banks, trust companies and other investment companies will require to at least having a notarized copy of the will or probated prior to releasing the funds.  Most provinces will charge probate fees.  If you plan your affairs so that your assets pass directly to your heirs the costs of probate fees could be reduced or eliminated.  However careful consideration should be given when planning for probate and you must do your due diligence.
</p>
<p>
Life Insurance or Segregated Funds - Review your insurance policies to make sure that you have enough insurance to protect your family in case of an untimely death, last expenses and tax implications.  Also review the beneficiary designations for all policies to confirm your wishes.
