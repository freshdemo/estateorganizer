		<h3>Compliments of:  Franca Perciballi EPC, CHS</h3>
		<p>


<p>
Everyone has an estate.
</p>
<p>
This is a tool that you may find useful in assisting the executor of your estate. Organizing your estate will bring peace of mind to you and to your heirs.  Having a good record will provide an opportunity to have your personal affairs in order.
Closing an estate can be a frustrating experience if all the pieces of the puzzle that can comprise estate are not in one place.
</p>
<p>
You can keep a printed copy of your Estate Organizer in safety deposit box if security is a concern.
Once you have filled in the information on your Estate Organizer, chose a memorable date every year when you will review the information and many any necessary changes.  In regards to your medical information, it would be a good idea to make the changes as soon as possible especially in regards to the medications.  If you use a pharmacy that provides you with the list of all your medications that would be helpful to just include the most recent list with your printed copies of your Estate Organizer.
</p>
<!-- <p>
When to Review your will
It is recommended that you review your will every three to five years or as per your lawyer’s advice.  However, you should review your will whenever circumstances in your life have changed, such as marriage as the will prior to marriage would normally be revoked, a death, separation or divorce, the birth of a child or your child or children have become of age and no longer need a guardian.  Also, if you had a specific asset which was willed and you have disposed of it.  A will should also be reviewed after a change to income tax laws or any other relevant legislation.
</p>
<p>
Naming of Executor for your will
Name an executor that you trust and that will have the time to execute your will as it is time consuming and you want to make sure that your affairs are in order for the beneficiaries.
Probate Fees
At death, the executor wills most likely have to have a court declare your will is valid and in order to deal with certain assets.  Depending on the amount of the assets, banks, trust companies and other investment companies will require to at least having a notarized copy of the will or probated prior to releasing the funds.  Most provinces will charge probate fees.  If you plan your affairs so that your assets pass directly to your heirs the costs of probate fees could be reduced or eliminated.  However, careful consideration should be given when planning for probate.  You must do your due diligence.
</p> -->
<p>
Powers of Attorney
In most provinces there are two types of powers of attorney, medical and financial, in case one becomes mentally incapacitated.
Life Insurance
Review your insurance policies to make sure that you have enough insurance to protect your family in case of an untimely death, last expenses and tax implications.  Also review the beneficiary designations for all policies to confirm your wishes.  
</p>


<h3>Some Things to Remember</h3>
<p>
What is the largest cash flow item you would worry about if you or your spouse were critically ill or unable to work.   How long would you be able to cover these expenses for?   Things to consider are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How much debt you have outstanding?</li>
<li>How much are your monthly expenses?</li>
<li>What kind of coverage do you have through your employer?</li>
<li>How long is the income insurance replacement with your employer for?</li>
<li>Do you actually have an income replacement?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Do you actually have an income replacement?
</p>
<p>
In case of a death, you have similar obligations.  There will also be the last expenses which will have to be considered.  Cash will be required to pay for funeral expenses, debts, possibly taxes on death, such as probate fees and capital gains and administration fees.  It’s not always possible to convert assets quickly into cash for the value you believe they should have.  For this reason life insurance can be of great value no matter how many assets one has.
</p>
<p>
Long Term Planning
</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify your goal</li>
<li>Decide how much you are going to allocate towards that goal</li>
</ul>
<p>
This allocation will give you a roadmap to financial flexibility and security and you will also ensure that if you encounter any road blocks  you will have structured a risk management solution.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set out your Financial Priorities</li>
<li>Manage your risk with Life Insurance, Critical Illness Insurance, Income Replacement and Long Term Care Insurance</li>
<li>Build your Net Worth by starting early, reducing taxes, maximizing on incentives and grants, contribute systematically,diversify amongst asset classes and review and rebalance periodically.</li>
</ul>
